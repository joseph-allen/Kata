1. Introduction and objectives
The analtysis will be devoted to apply multiple correspondence analysis to “New
Yok taxis” data using FactorMineR library.

The main objectives are to understand the relationships between the variable Total_amount
and/or Total_amount_inclass and a series of categorical variables.

2. Analysis of the variables influencing the total-amount (quantitative or in_class)
through MCA.

A MCA applied to these variables will provide a synthesis of them. The other variables,
available in the file, have to be used as illustrative. Total_amount is also used as
supplementary. Why?

Transform Total_amount, Trip_distance and Fare_ amount into discrete variables.
Transform the variable Extra into factor. See that MTA_tax, Tolls_amount and
improvement_surcharge would be inutilizable as factor because or presenting only one
category with number over 2% of the individuals.

Apply MCA to the data frame with the following columns: "Total_amount",
"Tamount_inclass" , "Trip_distance_inclass", "Fare_amount_inclass" , "Extra_fac" and
"MTA_tax_fac"

3. Comment the results following the usual outline:
- concerning the factorial methods:
 succession of eigenvalues and inertia ratios, number of retained factors
 (justified), “names” of the factors that summarize their interpretation
 representation of the results though clear and worked graphics.
 factor interpretation, one by one or by planes
 conclusion on the MCA results

The visualization part is relevant. So, the graphics should be worked, with clear
foots and/or captions.
