## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

running install sets up pre-commit tests

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

## Running the tests

run pytest :

```
pytest
```

or for test watcher :

```
ptw
```

generate HTML test coverage
```
pytest --cov --cov-report=html
```
## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
